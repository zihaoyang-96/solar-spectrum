The codes here are IDL programs used for solar spectroscopic analysis. 
## Predicting line intensities along the solar radial direction
The codes int_qs.pro, int_ch.pro, int_ar.pro, plot_i.pro, plot_i2.pro, plot_i3.pro are used to plot the predicted coronal emission line intensities along the solar radial direction. 
The formation process of the coronal optical thin emission lines includes collisional excitation and photoexcitation. We use CHIANTI version 8.0.2 to do the calculation.
